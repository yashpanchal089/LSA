Practical No: 3

• Aim: Configure NFS server to share directories or files on your network.


• Description:

1. The Network File System (NFS) is a client/server application that lets a computer user view and optionally store and 
   update files on a remote computer as though they were on the user's own computer. 

2. The NFS protocol is one of several distributed file system standards for network-attached storage(NAS).

3. NFS is kind of Google Drive.


• There are 3 types of NFS:

1. NFSv2 :- 
   > In this requests are based on per host basis and not on a per user.
   > Convenient for whole system.
   > TCP or UDP support.
   > File size limitation is less than 2GB.

2. NFSv3 :-
   > Bugs fixes of NFSv2, more features and more performance gain.
   > TCP or UDP support.
   > Support 2GB on server and more than 2GB on client.
   > Support is based on server file limit.

3. NFSv4 :-
   > Uses stateful protocol TCP or SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).
   > More security features and Kerberos.
   > Here, client authentication is per user basis and not per host basis.
   > RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).
   > It listens on port 2049.

 
• Steps and Commands:

1. Install NFS server:

   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install kernel-server

   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server

2. Command to enable a service:  
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

3. Now user needs to create a directory to show the function of NFS that is the mounting process
   yash@yash:~$ mkdir demo_dir
   yash@yash:~$ vi a.txt
   yash@yash:~$ ls a.txt
   yash@yash:~$ mv a.txt demo_dir
   yash@yash:~$ ls /home/yash/demo_dir

4. Now we have to mention our /directory_path ip_address (permissions), we need to give rw (read,write) permission,
   the commands for this is as follows:

   yash@yash:~$ sudo vi /etc/exports
   yash@yash:~$cat /etc/exports

  > After mentioning the /directory_path ip_address (permissions), it should look like this.
    /home/yash/demo_dir 127.0.0.1(rw)


5. Now to check the exports:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo exportfs -ra

6. To allow file sharing between systems on your network, the command is:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common

Note: Before mounting make sure that the user have made a directory to mount the file, if not the write the command to do so:
      yash@yash:~$ sudo mkdir /home/yash_directory

7. Now to mount the file:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.01:/home/yash/demo_dir /home/yash_directory

8. Lastly, then the user can check for the mounted file in the directory that user has made:-
   yash@yash:~$ cd /home/yash_directory
   ls
