Practcal - 5 
Aim :- Install Samba to share folders or files between Windows and Linux.

★ Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
★ It allows Linux to work with the Windows operating system, as both a server and a client.
★ Samba shares Linux files and printers with Windows systems, and also gives Linux users access 
  to files on Windows systems.

★ Several Samba packages are included with most of the Linux distributions:
   a. Samba: Provides an SMB/Common Internet File System (CIFS) server that can be used to provide 
             network services to SMB/CIFS clients
   b. Samba-client: Provides some SMB/CIFS clients to complement the built-in SMB/CIFS file system in 
      Linux. These clients allow access to SMB/CIFS shares and printing to SMB/CIFS printers.
   c. Samba-common: Provides files necessary for both the server and client Samba packages.

★ Types of Samba servers used while configuring Samba
   a. Stand-Alone Server.
   b. Domain Member Server.
   c. Domain Controller.

★ Samba Daemons and Services
  a. smbd: The server daemon that provides file-sharing and printing services to Windows clients. 
     It is also responsible for user authentication, resource locking, and data sharing through the SMB protocol.
  b. nmbd: The NetBIOS nameserver daemon replies to name-service requests produced by SMB/CIFS in Windows-based systems. 
     It also provides browsing support in the Windows Network Neighborhood view.

★ Steps and commands (Kali Linux part):
1. First we need to install Samba Server:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install samba

2. Then we need to start samba service:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd

3. Then we need to check the status samba service:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd

4. Then we need to start nmbd service:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl start nmbd

5. Then we need to start nmbd service:
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

6. First we make a samba_shared directory in /home/yash

7. Then we make few txt files in /home/yash/samba_shared 
   yash@yash:~$ touch a.txt b.txt c.txt  

8. Now,
   yash@yash:~$ cd /etc/samba
   yash@yash:~$ ls /etc/samba

9. Now take the backup of smb.conf 
   yash@yash:~$ cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 

10. Now we need to do few configuration in /etc/smb.conf
    yash@yash:~$ sudo nano smb.conf

11. Then delete all the things inside smb.conf and then write:
    [samba_shared]
	comment = Welcome to samba
	path = /home/yash/samba_shared
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = no

Then ctrl x and then y and save the file. 

12. Now download smbclient if not there then the command is:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install smbclient 

13. Now start/stop services of both smbd and nmbd
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl stop nmbd

Also, check both smbd and nmbd statuses too

14. First do: 
    yash@yash:~$ whoami
 
15. And then: 
    yash@yash:~$ sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)

16. Type and retype your password:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)

17. This will make any connectionn possible to connect:
    $ sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba

    In my case it was:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any app Samba

18. To check for your ip then use this command : 
    yash@yash:~$ ip a 		(OR) 
    yash@yash:~$ ip addr

19. Now to reload your firewall use:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo ufw reload

20. To check whether it's working or not, use:
    $ sudo smbcllient -U <username> -L  //your ip  
    
    In my case it was:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo smbcllient -U yash -L  //192.168.56.101

21. Now restart both smbd and nmbd services:
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl restart nmbd

22. Do also check their status 
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd
    yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

★ Windows OS Part:
1. Once smbd and nmbd services are active now switch back to your windows OS and press 
   windows + R key on keyboard and now a pop up box will open and their write smbclient ip address, 
   here in my case it was //192.168.56.101 and press OK.

2. Now again one more pop up box will open, write the credentials of your Windows or Kali or whatever it would be.

3. Now in top of the address bar you can see Network > 192.168.56.101 (your ip address)
   in this you can see samba_shared and documents folder.

4. In samba_shared server you can see all the txt files that we have made earlier, using touch command.

5. Once all your samba_shared files are visible in windows, then the sharing of files/folders have been 
   successfully done between Windows and Kali Linux.
