Aim:- Installing dhcp server

Explaination:-
★ DHCP stands for dynamic host configuration protocol and is a network protocol used on IP networks 
  where a DHCP server automatically assigns an IP addressand other information to each host on the
  network so they can communicate efficiently with other endpoints.

★ Every device on a TCP/IP-based network must have a unique unicast IP address to access the network
  and its resources. Without DHCP, IP addresses for new computers or computers that are moved from 
  one subnet to another must be configured manually; IP addresses for computers that are removed from 
  the network must be manually reclaimed.

★ DHCP is based on a client-server model and based on discovery, offer, request, and ACK

★ DHCP is a client-server protocol in which servers manage a pool of unique IP addresses, as well as
  information about client configuration parameters, and assign addresses out of those address pools.	

★ DHCP-enabled clients send a request to the DHCP server whenever they connect to a network.

Advantages of using DHCP:-
★ Centralized management of IP addresses
★ Ease of adding new clients to a network
★ Reuse of IP addresses reducing the total number of IP addresses that are required

Disadvantage of using DHCP:-
★ IP conflict can occur

Steps(comand)
1. Command to install dhcp-server:  
   yash@yash:~$sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server

2. Then configure your dhcpd.conf by directly editing through a path : 
   yash@yash:~$sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

3. You can get to know about your ip address by: 
   yash@yash:~$ip addr

4. We then configure the subnet and the netmask(dhcpd.conf), then save the file and exit

5. Then to enable the services use the command:
   yash@yash:~$sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server.service

6. Then start the service : 
   yash@yash:~$sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server.service
