Practical No: 6

• Aim: Configure NFS server to share directories or files on your network.

★ NFS stand for Network File System

★ It allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network and interact
   with those file systems as though they are mounted locally.\

★ There are 3 types of NFS:

1) NFSv2 :- 
   • In this requests are based on per host basis and not on a per user.
   • Convenient for whole system.
   • TCP or UDP support.
   • File size limitation is less than 2GB.


•  Steps and Commands:

a. Install NFS server:

   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install kernel-server

   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server

b. Command to enable a service:  
   
   yash@yash:~$ sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

c. Now user needs to create a directory to show the function of NFS that is the mounting process

   yash@yash:~$ mkdir demo_dir
   yash@yash:~$ vi a.txt
   yash@yash:~$ ls a.txt
   yash@yash:~$ mv a.txt demo_dir
   yash@yash:~$ ls /home/yash/demo_dirr

d. Now we have to mention our /directory_path ip_address (permissions), we need to give rw (read,write) permission,
   the commands for this is as follows:

   yash@yash:~$ sudo vi /etc/exports
   yash@yash:~$cat /etc/exports
  
   >After mentioning the /directory_path ip_address (permissions), it should look like this.
    /home/yash/demo_dir 127.0.0.1(rw)

e. Now to check the exports:
   
   yash@yash:~$ sudo exportfs -ra

f. To allow file sharing between systems on your network, the command is:
  
   yash@yash:~$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common

g. Now to mount the file:

   shibu@kali:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.01:/home/yash/demo_dir /home/yash_directory

h. Lastly, then the user can check for the mounted file in the directory that user has made:
 
   yash@yash:~$ cd /home/shibu_directory
   ls
