Practical No: 2

â€¢ Aim: Initial settings: Add a user, Network settings, Configure services and List of services.

1.) Adding a user: 
    A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service.
    A user the one who works on the machine or have the permissions to read, write and execute particular or all files.
    A user can be added individually or they can be added in a group.

    command: 
    $sudo ip a   (or)  $sudo ip addr
    
3.) Configuring services: 
    services are also known as daemons which efficiently run in the background, services usually have a 'd' in last 
    of their name to identify it as a daemon 
    
    For example - smbd , nmbd,etc
    Services can be lookout in the /etc/ folder as mostly the services lie there for 
			  
    Example: $sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 

4.) List of services running: command to list the currently active and running services:- 
    $sudo systemctl

5.) Commands:-

    Command to enable a service:
    $sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
    Eg: $sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-serevr.service 
    
    Command to start a service: 
    $sudo systemctl start <service_name>
    Eg: $sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-serevr.service	
    
    Command to check the status of a service:
    $sudo systemctl status <service_name>
    Eg: $sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-serevr.service
    
    Command to stop a service: 
    $sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
    Eg: $sudo systemctl stop isc-dhcp-serevr.service
    
    Command to auto-start a service:
